A long wooden pole with a blade (ON _blað_) at one end and a handle (ON _hlumr_) at the other, pivoted in pairs on the side of a ship to propel the vessel through water.  

Oars were critical for moving and steering Viking ships, especially in unfavorable wind conditions, and close quaters naval combat. No intact oars have been perserved as to determine their original length. However, their estimated size can be inferred from the dimensions of oarholes found in the hulls of preserved vessels. (Crumlin-Pedersen, 126).  The largest Viking ships could have more than 30 oars per side (Crumlin-Pedersen, 92).
