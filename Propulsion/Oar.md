Oar (Danish: åre, German: Riemen, Old Norse: áre)

Oars on Viking ships were critical for moving and steering the ship, especially in unfavorable wind conditions. The length of oar varied based on the position of the rower; if you are seated at the front of the ship, you are generally higher up than those towards the middle and rear, and as a result, require longer oars. The largest Viking ships could have as many as 30 oars per side (Jesch).
