Oar (Danish: åre, German: Riemen, Old Nourse: árar)
Oars on Viking ships were typically made out of woods such as ash, oak, or spruce. The length of oars was also very important; if you are seated at the front of the ship, you are generally higher up than those towards the middle and rear. As a result, those at the front require longer oars. The largest Viking ships could have in excess of 30 oars on each side.
