A long wooden pole with a blade (ON _blað_) at one end and a handle (ON _hlumr_) at the other, pivoted in pairs on the side of a ship to propel the vessel through water.  

Oars were critical for moving and steering Viking ships, especially in unfavorable wind conditions. The length of oar varied based on the position of the rower; if you are seated at the front of the ship, you are generally higher up than those towards the middle and rear, and as a result, require longer oars. The largest Viking ships could have as many as 30 oars per side (Jesch).
