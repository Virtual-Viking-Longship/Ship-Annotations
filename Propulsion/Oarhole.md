  A common practice was to levy taxes based on the amount of oarports present on a ship; Harthacnut's tax of 8 marks on each crew member, for example, was tabulated by the number of oarsmen's places (oarports) (Jesch, 156). Jesch discusses the occurence of these two words throughout the Skaldic corpus; though the words were oftentimes utilized in different contexts, both tend to refer metaphorically to the oarmen's place the oar, as opposed to a specific device (Jesch, 156).
