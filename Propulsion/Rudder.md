_**stýri** n., pl. stýri_ (Old Norse) [citations: [prose](https://onp.ku.dk/onp/onp.php?o76543)/[poetry](https://lexiconpoeticum.org/m.php?p=lemma&i=80522)]  

  A large oar that served as the primary means of steering a viking ship, mounted vertically on the right, starboard (_stýr borð_) side and moved by the helmsman by means of a tiller.

  _Stýri_ is the word for the steering arrangement on a viking ship, and while usually referring to just the rudder, the term sometimes suggests both the rudder and the tiller together (Jesch, 159). Rudders were mounted on the right side of viking ships, in contrast to modern vessels where the rudder is usually centered on the stern. The steering side (_stýr borð_) of the ship thus gives us the English term "starboard," and the non-steering, left side is where one ties up at "port."  Rudders are prominently displayed in a number of surviving illustrations of ships, and experimental reconstructions have helped determine how they were attached and used (Horte).
