  Many ship finds have included broken rowlocks, to the extent that there is evidence that workshops existed for the repair of boats which had damaged their rowlocks. A wide range of differing rowlocks have been found, spanning various locations and distinct time periods within the Viking Age (generally considered to 800-1100). The various methods of mounting rowlocks were probably primarily determined by the thickness of the ships’ sheerstrakes (Crumlin-Pedersen, 126).
