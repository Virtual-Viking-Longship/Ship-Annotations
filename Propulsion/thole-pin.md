  Archaelogical finds indicate that the movement of the oars, controlled at the point where they rest on the ship, was dependent on the size of the ship itself. Jesch discusses these differences at length, stating that smaller ships were generally powered by oars mounted on thole-pins, similar to those pictured above (Jesch, 155).
