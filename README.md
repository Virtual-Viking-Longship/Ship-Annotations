# Ship-Annotations

This repository holds illustrated annotations to accompany the [Virtual Viking Longship Project](https://virtualvikings.sites.carleton.edu). Annotations are written in markdown and are used in VR experiences developed in Unity, leveraging [FancyTextRendering](https://github.com/JimmyCushnie/FancyTextRendering) to render markdown & clickable links with Unity's TextMeshPro library.

You are welcome to use or reference these materials in your projects, but please cite the VVLP project according to [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) criteria. Suggested citation below.
