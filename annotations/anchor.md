Anchors were critical for controlling and docking Viking ships, especially in storms or during raids. Anchors were used when camping aboard a ship at night or when preparing for stealthy attacks (Jesch 166). It is believed that Viking Age anchors were made of iron or a composite of wood, stone, and rope. The former would have been expensive and used on large ships while the latter would be more affordable and used on small ships (Crumlin-Pederson, 146).
