  The frame of a Viking ship is formed by the transverse internal structural members: the floor timbers (ribs), beams and naturally curved knees that sit above them. Later ships have multiple beams, with the upper thrwarts seperating the rowing rooms and serving as rowing benches (Sørensen 16). The Gokstad ship and other early examples have only a single course of _bitis_ supported by central stanchions atop the ribs that in turn hold the deck boards (Bischoff 74).
