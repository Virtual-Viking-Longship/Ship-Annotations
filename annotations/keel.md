   The keel is the spine of the ship, which on a Viking longship was usually around 50 to 60 feet in length. It would be ideal for the keel to be shaped 
   from a single trunk of an oak tree, as this would give the keel greater strength, though keels for large ships may have been pieced together and joined 
   with rivets. Boatbuilders would have used specialized axes, as well as hammers, mallets, drills, biles, planers and scrapers, to cut and shape the wood. 
   The keel had a T shape to accept the strakes, or wooden planks, that formed the hull (_húfr_ m.; Old Norse). The rest of the ship would be built up from 
   this central piece.
