  Formed of naturally forked wood for strength, the  knees connect the horizontal _bitis_ or other thwart beams to the upper rows of strakes above the water line (Sørensen 16). Knees were also important for sailing a Viking ship, since they often had attachment points for the lines of the rigging. On the Oseberg ship, the backside of all the knees had semi-circular cutouts with beveled edges, which reconstructions have proven work well for attaching ropes and controlling the sail (Bischoff 182).
