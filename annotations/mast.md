  The rectangular viking sail was raised onto the mast and supported along its upper edge by a yard, this was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers. The largest Viking ships could have a mast more than 70-feet long. Masts were also said to bend during heavy storms and wind due to the height (Jesch, 160).
