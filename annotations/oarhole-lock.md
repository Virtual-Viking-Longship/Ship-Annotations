  A small wooden device used to close the oarholes when not in use to prevent the ship taking on water.

  The exact shape and function of oarhole-locks varies between ship finds: those at Hedeby are simple plugs, while the locks from Gokstad pivoted and latched on pins driven into the hull on either side of the hole (Nicolaysen 59). Oarhole-locks may have "belonged" to each rower, as many were personalised with carved decorations (Crumlin-Petersen 126).
