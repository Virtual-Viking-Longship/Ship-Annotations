  Parrel from Oseberg Ship (Brøgger Fig. 121)

</div>
  A wooden parrel is tied to the middle part of the yard around the mast when the sail is in use and untied when the sail is taken down. The parrel found with the Oseberg ship had a triangular hole for separate lashings to the yard at either end, although its proper function was not recognized at the time (Brøgger et al 321; Bischoff 21).
