  A reef allows someone to adjust the sails (sigla) area depending on wind conditions, reefing is done by rolling apart of the sail inward.

  In connection with hard winds the sail is reduced in size to ensure that the ship does not heel over. Reefing can be done in advance at the top of the sail. If reefing is done while sailing the sail is reefed from the bottom of the sail (Gersbøll). The points were placed diagonally so
when reefed that part of the sail nearest to the sea was narrower than the upper part (Lotus Magazine).
