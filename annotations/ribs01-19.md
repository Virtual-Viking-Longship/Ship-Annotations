   Ribs are lateral structural members that emerge from the keel and run up to the waterline. The ship's outer planking is attached to the ribs.

   As the strakes reached the desired height, the interior ribs were added. Ribs stiffen the hull transversely and ensure that the ship maintains the correct form. 
   Viking boat builders used a spacing of roughly 850 - 950 mm (33-37  inches) between ribs to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space 
   for the sea chests, which were used by sailors as seats (_sess_ m.; Old Norse) while rowing the boat. The ribs would be individually hewn and shaped so as to ensure 
   a tight fit with the strakes.
