  Carved rowlocks from the boats in the Gokstad ship, with holes drilled to accept the oar-grommets (Nicolaysen Pl. V, Fig. 5,6,9,13,15)

In the Viking Age, the oars of small boats were usually pulled against curved wood on the upper strake of boats’ sides, and/or thole pins driven into holes in the gunwale (Jesch, 155). Both were often held in place by oar-grommets (ON _ hömlu-bönd_). The various methods of mounting rowlocks were probably primarily determined by the thickness of the ships’ sheerstrakes (Crumlin-Pedersen, 126).
