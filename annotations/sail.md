  Viking Age ships were square-rigged, with symmetrical square sails hung perpendicular to both mast and keel. Iconographic sources and experimental reconstructions of archaeological finds have shown that the width of sails was just under half the length of the ship (Bischoff, 157). They were most often made from wool woven in strips that were sown together vertically and then smeared with tallow or other fats (Bischoff, 164-5; Cooke and Christiansen, 73).
