  Sails were not used in early type Viking ships but were developed for long voyages. The Viking ship could not have accomplished what it did in respect to travel over long distances and in raiding operations without sails (Bruun, Per). Sails enable Vikings to rely on stable winds as well as rowing, proving for a less tiring travel (Cooke, Bill).
