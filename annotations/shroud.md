Typically, boats would contain a mast steadied by a stay lashed to the forepost, and two to three shrounds on each side of the post. The shrouds require a system for tightening the ropes and adjusting them on various occasions in the course of the sailing season, this would involve the shroud-pin and shroud-ring which would connect the ropes to a pulley sytem in order to loosen and tighten supporting ropes. (Nicholayson 20)
