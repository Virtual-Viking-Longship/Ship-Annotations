A rope or cable that supports the mast from either side, connected to a shroud-ring in the hull by a shroud-pin: a curved wooden pin which could be loosened quickly to lower the mast.

The standing rigging (ON _skrúð_) of Viking ships typically steadied the mast with a stay lashed to the forestem, and two or more shrouds connected to the hull on each side. The shrouds would need to be loosened in a hurry to lower the mast in order to pass under bridges, and the shroud-pin could be slipped out of the shroud-ring to quickly loosen the supporting ropes (Nicolaysen 20). This may explain why the distinction between standing and running rigging (ON _reiði_) was less relevant in Old Norse vocabulary, since the mast was regularly raised and lowered just like the sail (Jesch 165).
