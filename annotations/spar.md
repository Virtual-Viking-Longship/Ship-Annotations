  Also called a Bietiass, a spar is a long wooden pole connected to the sail (_segl_), used to angle the sail into the wind creating a technique called tacking.

  Use of the beitiass reduces strain on the side of a ship, by spreading the pressure from the sail over to the opposite side, where the forces can be spread over several frames (Bishcoff, Vibeke).
