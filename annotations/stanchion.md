  The Gokstad ship had three upright stanchions running down the center line, each topped by a cross beam with semi-circular depressions to hold spars. The fore and aft stanchions are stepped into the bottom of the ship and pass through a small fish shaped block so they can be removed when not needed. The central stanchion is secured directly to the mast fish with a tripod-like structure (Nicolaysen 55).
