  Stays were critical components of the standing rigging that kept the mast upright under pressure on the sail during high winds. They were fixed around the top of the mast above the hole for the halyard, and slanted down at a characteristically sharp angle, captured in the phrase "leaning like a stay" found in Skaldic verses (Nicolaysen 20; Jesch 165).
