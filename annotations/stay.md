  The stay was critical for supporting the yard to the mast-head and forcing the sail to 'stay' up during high winds. (Jesch, 165). They were fixed around the top of the mast, and close under the place where the ropes met, a hole was made which the hoisting rope for the yard was then passed through (Nicolaysen, 20).
