  Strakes are made up of overlapping wooden planks that extend up and out from the keel to form the sides of the ship. This joining of strakes is called _skǫr_ (ON f. pl. _skarar_) (Jesch, 139-140). Strakes were riven, or radially hewn, so that the wood grain is at right angles to the surface of the plank. This made the wood more flexible and stronger, and allowed for even expansion and contraction in water. The strakes overlapped by 25-30 mm (roughly one inch) and were held in place using iron clench nails in what is now referred to as “clinker-built” or lapstrake construction. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. This type of construction allows the ship’s hull to flex as it moves through the water and provides additional longitudinal strength to it.
