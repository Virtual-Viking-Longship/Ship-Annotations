  The lowest corner of the front of the sail which is secured to the hull when changing direction (tacking) in order to sail into the wind. On a viking ship, the tack thus changes from one corner of the square sail to the other as the ship tacks back and forth to move upwind.

  The tack was an important part of the Viking sail to which ropes were attached to manuever the ship and control the sail in harsh wind conditions. It is known that the tack was often fastened to holes on the side of the hull either by clamps or belaying pins (Bischoff 8).
