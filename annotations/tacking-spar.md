 A spar (ON *áss*) attached to the bottom foremost corner of a square sail to keep it strained when beating against the wind or tacking.

  Moving the tacking spar angles the sail, allowing the ship to tack into the wind (Hale 1998, 62). Its use reduces strain on the side of a ship by distributing the pressure from the sail over to the opposite side, where the forces can be spread over several frames (Bischoff 2017, 2). The use of the _beitiáss_ is known from written sources like the kings' sagas, iconographic sources like the Gotland picture stones, and from ethnographic boat traditions from northwestern Iceland (Bischoff 2017, 6).
