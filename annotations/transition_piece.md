  Transition pieces connect the horizontal keel to the vertical stems. These pieces would be hewn from a single piece of wood, which boatbuilders would cut from large, curved branches of an oak tree. As the ship moves through the water, ice, or is beached, a single piece of wood provides more strength to a weaker area of the hull. These transition pieces would be attached by rivets to the stem and keel with a scarf joint. This joint is formed by cutting opposing tapered ends on each piece of wood, which are then fitted together with rivets.
