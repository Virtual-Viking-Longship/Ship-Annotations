  The keel on a Viking ship usually consists of a single curved timber, but on larger ships transition pieces were used to connect the horizontal keel to the vertical stems. In more recent Norwegian boat building, the keel is divided in three, and the transitions (Norwegian _lot_) slope upward from the flat keel. Viking Age transition pieces were attached to the stem and keel with a riveted scarf joint, formed by cutting opposing tapered ends on each piece of wood.
