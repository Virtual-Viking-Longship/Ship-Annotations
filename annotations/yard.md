  The yard kept the sail strained during winds, allowing for ships to be moved without rowing. A brace rope was placed at each end of the yard to allow the yard to move to any position the wind required (Nicolaysen, 20). The yard was one of the parts of the ship that was most vulnerable to damage in storms or hard weather. They were typically long, slender and made of fir or pinewood (Jesch, 162)
