Local to Hedeby, the antlers of red deer were used for many purposes, but were particularly essential to the making of combs (Schietzel, 342). These delicately crafted combs were used for regular hair care and hygiene, pulling out lice and nits with their fine teeth (Schietzel, 282). Though combs were in high demand, the need for production was not year-round, suggesting that expert combmakers were either involved in another local trade or traveled from site to site to sell their product (Maixner, 59).
