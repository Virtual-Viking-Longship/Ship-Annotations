Scales were an indispensable aspect of trade. Although it’s unlikely that traders used standardized units for weight corresponding to an objective value, each trader’s scale provided a personal, subjective frame of reference for the worth of a particular amount of silver or other traded material (Maixner, 187). Equal-arm balances, made of copper alloy, were used for this purpose, though their shape made them susceptible to damage in transport (Maixner, 186). Scale pans, composed of horn or pounded metal, were made to be as light as possible to lessen the chance of their weight disturbing the balance (Maixner, 186). Small holes were punched into the pan so that they could be suspended from the scale via ribbons, likely made of linen (Maixner, 186).
