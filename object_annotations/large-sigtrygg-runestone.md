Large Sigtrygg runestone, DR 2, from Hedeby (Schietzel, 180).

</div>

In the first third of the tenth century, King Gnupa, based in Hedeby, took power as ruler of the Danes. He was succeeded by his son, Sigtrygg, who was deposed shortly after 934 AD (Maixner, 90). Asfrid, his mother and Gnupa’s widow, commissioned two runestones for her deceased son, perhaps in a failed attempt to consolidate the lineage of which Sigtrygg was ultimately the final king (Maixner, 102).
