The handle on this cup is not broken, but purposely shaped to jut out instead of reconnecting with the body in a loop. A single handle may indicate that the vessel was used one-handed as a scoop, perhaps to scoop a drink (Schietzel, 333). Handled or stemmed vessels were used as tableware or ladles (Schietzel, 248).
