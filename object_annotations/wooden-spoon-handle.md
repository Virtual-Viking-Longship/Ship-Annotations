Dragon head motifs were not uncommon in woodworking and other methods of ornamentation (Schietzel, 465). Objects in daily use sometimes had ornamentation, although it is unclear if this handle was part of a functional or decorative piece. Spoons and ladles were used for eating and serving porridge and other foods (Schietzel, 248).
